# CosmWasm-for-true-beginners

This is a tutorial for true beginners in the realm of software development.

I will use this tutorial to create a quickstart guide for myself, and eventually I hope it can help others in their journey.

First, dependencies, which are the programs needed to get started.

This is also called "setting up your developer environment".

My current developer environment is Windows Subsystem for Linux or (WSL) on Windows 11
On Windows Subsystem for Linux, I am running the Ubuntu distribution or "distro"
My IDE or "Integrated Developer Environment" text editing software is Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

So -> WSL, Ubuntu

Once you have that going, you will need to install a bunch of programs.

You need:

Go
Rust
Wasmd
Cargo
Docker
and several others.
